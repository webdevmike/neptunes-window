						<h2>Aquarium Maintenance</h2>
						<div class="description">Aquarium maintenance is the core of our business.  While it’s not the most romantic aspect of what we do, it is inevitable that any aquarium will in time, develop unsightly algae and accumulate fish waste.  There is a sort of art to cleaning these systems, requiring a discerning eye and implementing a process that is both efficient and thorough.</div>

						<h2>Aquarium Refurbishing</h2>
						<div class="description">Often we get asked on consultation visits what we can do to bring an aquarium system “back to life”.  Many times a display can be rejuvenated with nothing more than a thorough cleaning and some aesthetic adjustments.  Other times a complete filtration overhaul is needed.  Regardless of the scope of the refurbishing job, we can work with your budget to ensure your aquarium system adds beauty and interest to your space.</div>

						<h2>Emergency Aquarium Services</h2>
						<div class="description">It’s an unfortunate fact… Aquarium systems are powered by mechanical components that have a tendency over time to fail.  At Neptune’s Window we take a proactive approach of redundancy and proper equipment maintenance to minimize mechanical issues.  However, in the rare case that an issue should arise, we are available 24/7 to address your concerns.</div>
